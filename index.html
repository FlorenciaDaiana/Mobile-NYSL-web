                    <h3>Dimensions.</h3> FIFA Law 1 provides for flexible external field dimensions within a given
                    maximum and minimum width and length. These dimensions should be adhered to for all fields used by
                    teams under 12 and older.
                  </li>

                  <li>
                    <h3>Competition Fields.</h3> Fields used within the competition program must be a minimum of 100 x
                    60 yards. Leagues, districts or associations participating in the state competition program that
                    are unable to provide a field that meets these minimum requirements must advise the State
                    Competition Board which will assign its Fields Committee to inspect the field and recommend to the
                    Board whether or not a waiver of the minimum dimensions should be granted. Teams from leagues,
                    districts or associations that are unable to provide an acceptable field may be required to play
                    all their games away.
                  </li>

                    <ol type="a">
                      <li>U-6 play on a field approximately 20 X 40 yards with no penalty areas. Fields for older age
                        groups should be progressively larger.</li>
                      <li>U-8 plays on a field 40-50 yards in length and 20-30 yards width.</li>
                      <li>U-10 play on a field 70-80 yards in length and 40-50 yards in width.</li>
                      <li>In addition, fields used by young age groups may have their internal dimensions and size of
                        goal similarly modified.</li>

                          <li>The decision for team/spectator placement on the field will be made by the governing
                            body of that team. A team's bench area shall consist of that area at least one (1) yard
                            away from the touchline and extending to twenty yards (20) both ways from the halfway
                            line. In the event that field 2 conditions require team benches to be on the same side of
                            the field, a team's bench area shall consist of that area two(2) yards away from the
                            touchline and extending twenty yards one (1) way from the halfway line.</li>
                          <li>The home team has first choice as to where it wishes to locate its bench area. Coaches
                            and substitutes are required to remain within their bench area during the game. Parents
                            and spectators should occupy the same side of the field as the team they are supporting.

                            be along the same touchline. Each team bench area shall be located two yards outside the
                            touchline, beginning not closer than five yards from midfield and extending not further
                            than twenty yards from midfield. The home team shall have the right to choose the location
                            of its bench area. Coaches and substitutes must remain within their team's bench area
                            during the game.</li>
                          <li>Parents and spectators must occupy the sideline opposite the team bench areas.
                            Supporters of a team must assemble on the side of the midfield facing the team bench area
                            of that team. There shall be a buffer zone extending ten yards on each side of the
                            midfield that may not be occupied by parents or spectators. Match officials shall be
